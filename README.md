### 30 Day Map Challenge 2022

My contributions to the #30DayMapChallenge2022 initiated by Topi Tjukanov.

#### Day 1: Points
Ever wondered where you can find one of Earth's weirdest-looking birds? Here is the distribution of the monstrous nightbird, the Great Potoo.

#### Day 2: Lines
India's railways are essential to rural-urban migration. Studies find that migrants working in cities closer than an overnight train ride from their native place have improved savings capacity.

#### Day 3: Polygons
In Mumbai, a city of over 25 million people, there are few large open spaces--and many are not freely accessible to the public. 

#### Day 4: Colour Friday
Trying out some 3D mapping with raster + rayshader
Istanbul, Turkiy(e)

#### Day 5: Ukraine
Chernozem is a highly fertile black topsoil whose prevalence throughout Ukraine is why the country is widely known as the "breadbasket of Europe." 

#### Day 6: Networks
Male, the island capital of the Maldives, is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. This map shows "betweenness centrality"--which street intersections connect the most parts of the city to each other. 

#### Day 7: Raster
Volcanoes + earthquakes + bears = #kamchatka

#### Day 8: Data: OSM
Southeastern DRC's economy has long been based in mineral extraction, specifically copper and cobalt. Railways are fragmented and typically connect river ports, the primary means of transport in the country.

#### Day 9: Space
In the Arabian Peninsula's Rub' al-Khali, or "Empty Quarter" in Arabic, you'll have plenty of space to yourself. Enjoy the sand dunes and lack of humans. 

#### Day 10: A Bad Map
What if gerrymandering resulted in just two congressional districts? 
- Pioneering infra, i.e. CA-HI sea link
- Land swaps of enclaves for coastal rds
- Invalid polygon border xings
QGIS: "Task failed successfully"

#### Day 11: Colour Friday: Red
Monthly Air Quality Index readings for 5 major cities in India. Note reductions due to monsoon + COVID lockdowns! 

#### Day 12: Scale
Comparing city sizes of Mumbai + Washington DC
Fun obs: 
Length of National Mall = 
Length of longest BOM runway = 
Length of rail track from Bandra Station to Santacruz Station

#### Day 13: 5 Minute Map
Driving with the windows open for 5 minutes in Mumbai's evening commute revealed some (not so surprising) trends. 

#### Day 14: Hexagons
Walking down any street in Mumbai, you're likely to pass by Vijay, Rajshree, Puja, or Ankur. 
But these aren't people--they're apartment names! 
When a developer names a building, do they favour one gender over another?

#### Day 15: Food/Drink
Inspired by John Oliver's piece on Subway franchises' ubiquity (https://youtube.com/watch?v=jDdYFhzVCDM), here is further confirmation.
 
#### Day 16: Minimal
The Monito del Monte, or chumaihuÃ©n (local Mapuche name), is a tiny marsupial native only to the forests of southwestern Chile and Argentina. 

#### Day 17: Map Without Computer
Mumbai 3022: Due to climate change, the Arabian Sea has reclaimed much of Mumbai. The city's remaining urban population has formed a series of smaller towns connected by a ferry system.

#### Day 18: Colour Friday: Blue
In India, unseasonal rainfall and water scarcity are key "push" factors in rural-to-urban migration flows. Last month, >80% of India's districts experienced either deficient or excess rainfall.

#### Day 19: Globe
Some days it just seems like all the world is hanging by a (orange fiber) thread. 

#### Day 20: My Favourite...
Autumn in New England is a spectacular time of year, before the forever winter sets in. Color-coded by each tree type's most common autumn color 

#### Day 21: Data: Kontur Population Dataset
Looking at population + rail transit, we can see how Indian cities grow along key transit corridors. 

#### Day 22: NULL
A simple R map of "terra nullius", or a land that no one technically owns (yet)--Antarctica.
